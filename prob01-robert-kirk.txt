Essay area

1. 	Stash: move files in the workspace to the stash area.
	Unstash: merge stashed files with the files in the workspace.
	Commit: Stages the files int the current branch in the local repository.
	Checkout branch: switches the current workspace's files with the branch being switched to's files. Uncommitted or unstashed work is effectively deleted.
	
2. 	Switching branches is performed when you need to look at code that is available on another branch. For example, a developer on your team 
	creates a very useful interface and you would like to use it to develop a feature. Using SCM, you will need to checkout their branch and 
	to view and interact with the code.

3.	Tag is to label work so that you can have a history of what has happened to the code over time. Files tagged with 0.1v are marked differently from 1.0v.
	This would allow for rolling back to be accomplished with relative ease.
